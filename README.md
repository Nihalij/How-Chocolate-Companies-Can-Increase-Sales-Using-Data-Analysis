# Chocolate Sales Analysis 📊

Exploratory data analysis of chocolate sales data to identify top products, inefficient markets, and high-performing salespersons using Python and data visualization.

## Objective
This project analyzes chocolate sales data to identify revenue drivers, underperforming products, regional inefficiencies, and salesperson effectiveness. The goal is to support data-driven business decisions related to inventory allocation, product strategy, and sales optimization.

## Key Questions Answered

- Which products generate the highest revenue?
- Which countries have high shipments but low revenue efficiency?
- Who are the most efficient salespersons?
- Does removing low-performing products impact revenue?

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

##Key Findings

A small subset of products contributes disproportionately to total revenue.
Certain countries show high shipment volume but lower revenue efficiency.
Top-performing salespersons are not those with highest volume, but highest revenue efficiency.
Optimizing product focus and regional allocation could improve overall profitability."""
